Calamus is a compositional instrument that breaks from keyboard thinking. Using a pen tablet as primary input, it captures expressive gesture as the notation itself — the act of composing IS the performance. Voices share a sonic DNA, built on a tuning-agnostic foundation. The sound engine uses "physics modeling" (not physical modeling) — invented laws governing mass, inertia, and parameter coupling — creating sounds that are alive but controllable. No MIDI. No piano roll. A new paradigm for writing expressive music.
